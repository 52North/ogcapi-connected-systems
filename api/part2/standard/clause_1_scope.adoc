== Scope

This standard defines extensions to https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features[OGC API - Features] for exposing dynamic data flowing to and from observing systems and platforms. This standard also complies with https://ogcapi.ogc.org/common[OGC API - Common].

The API provides an actionnable implementation of concepts defined in the https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/[Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN)].

More specifically, Part 2 of the API implements additional SSN concepts (namely Observation, Actuation, Result and Sample).

The following types of resources are made availables through this API:

  - `Datastream` 
  - `Observation` 
  - `Control Stream` 
  - `Command` 
  - `Command Status`
  - `System Event`
  - `Resource Events`
