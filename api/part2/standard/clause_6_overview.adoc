== Overview
=== General

OGC Web API Standards enable access to resources using the HTTP protocol and its associated operations (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.). 

#TODO#

All resources defined in Part 1 of this Standard are feature resources, among which the `System` resource. Part 2 (this document) defines additional resource types to describe and interact with the dynamic data that flows in and out of these systems.

Flows carrying data coming out of a system are called `Datastreams` while flows carrying data sent to a system are called `Control Channels`. 

Part 2 of this Standard defines resource types that allow the provision of dynamic data about all kinds of devices, hardware components or processes that can transmit and/or receive data via communication networks (a.k.a. connected systems), including sensors, platforms, robots, human observers, forecast models, computer simulations, etc.


=== Design Considerations

=== Resource Types

As indicated above, while part 1 of this Standard focused on defining "static" feature types, part 2 defines additional resources to deal with dynamic data associated to these features.

<<api-class-diagram>> shows a UML class diagram of all Connected Systems API resources. Resources defined in part 2 are shown with a solid border while resources that were already defined in part 1 are shown with a dashed light gray outline.
