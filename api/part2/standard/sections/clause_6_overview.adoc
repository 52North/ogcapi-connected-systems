== Overview
=== General

All resources defined in Part 1 of this Standard are feature resources, among which the `System` resource. Part 2 (this document) defines additional resource types to describe and interact with the dynamic data that flows in and out of these systems.

Part 2 of this Standard defines resource types that allow the provision of dynamic data about all kinds of devices, hardware components or processes that can transmit and/or receive data via communication networks (a.k.a. connected systems), including sensors, platforms, robots, human observers, forecast models, computer simulations, etc.

Flows carrying observation and status data coming out of a system are called `Datastreams` while flows carrying commands sent to a system are called `Control Streams` (note that the direction of the flow mentionned here is relative to the real system, which is different from the direction of the data flows going in and out of the API server). 


=== Design Considerations

#TODO#

Modeling of Observations not as Feature Resources
to Keep features separate from the properties and estimate of these properties (obs is an event that captures information about when and how the estimate of hte property was collected) 


=== Resource Types

As indicated above, while part 1 of this Standard focused on defining "static" feature types, part 2 defines additional resources to deal with dynamic data associated to these features.

<<api-class-diagram>> shows a UML class diagram of all Connected Systems API resources. Resources defined in part 2 are shown with a solid border while resources that were already defined in part 1 are shown with a dashed light gray outline.

| *Resource Type*    | *Requirements Class*      | *Description*          | *Possible Encodings*
| DataStream         | <<clause-datastreams>>    | Description of datastreams, including observed properties and features of interest.| JSON
| Observation        | <<clause-datastreams>>    | Actual observations, including the result data. | JSON, SWE-JSON, SWE-Text, SWE-Binary
| ControlStream      | <<clause-controlstreams>> | Description of control channels, including controllable properties and features of interest. | JSON
| Command            | <<clause-controlstreams>> | Actual command messages, including the command parameters data. | JSON, SWE-JSON, SWE-Text, SWE-Binary
| Command Status     | <<clause-controlstreams>> | Status info about a given command. | JSON
| Command Result     | <<clause-controlstreams>> | Result of a given command. | JSON
| System Event       | <<clause-system-events>>  | System events (e.g. deployment, maintenance or replacement events). | SML-JSON

NOTE: The encodings listed in the table are the ones defined in this Standard document but extensions can define additional encodings.



=== API Endpoints

{ogcapi-cs-1} defines the concept of canonical *resources endpoint* and *canonical resource endpoint*. This section provides the canonical endpoints used in CS API Part 2.

==== Canonical Resources Endpoints

The canonical resources endpoints for resource types defined in Part 2 of the CS API Standard are:

- `{api_root}/datastreams`
- `{api_root}/observations`
- `{api_root}/controlstreams`
- `{api_root}/commands`
- `{api_root}/systemEvents`

==== Canonical Resource Endpoints

The canonical URL templates to access a single resource defined in Part 2 of the CS API Standard are:

- `{api_root}/datastreams/{id}`
- `{api_root}/observations/{id}`
- `{api_root}/controlstreams/{id}`
- `{api_root}/commands/{id}`
- `{api_root}/systemEvents/{id}`
