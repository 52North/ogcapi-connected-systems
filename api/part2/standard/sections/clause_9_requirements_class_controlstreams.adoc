== Requirements Class "Control Streams & Commands"

=== Overview
include::../requirements/controlstream/requirements_class_controlstream.adoc[]

This requirements class specifies how `ControlStream`, `Command`, and `CommandStatus` resources are provided using the CS API.

A `ControlStream` resource represents a control channel that is used to change the state of (or affect) a feature of interest (which can be a `System` itself). The state is changed by sending the desired values of certain controllable properties of the feature of interest, but note that the resulting state will not necessarily reflect the exact values requested (If the exact result state must be known, it can be monitored separately using an associated `DataStream` resource).

A `ControlStream` resource represents the real-time stream of command messages sent to the system, as well as all historical commands received through the channel. It can be used to provide access to real-time commands only, archived commands only, or both. The metadata in the `ControlStream` description can used to disambiguate between these cases.

`Command` resources are available through their parent `ControlStream` resource, and each command can lead to the creation of one or more status reports (i.e. `CommandStatus` resources).

`ControlStream` and `Command` resources implement the _http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/ActuationCollection[ActuationCollection]_ and _http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Actuation[Actuation]_ concepts defined in the {ogc-w3c-ssn}, respectively.



[[clause-controlstream-resource]]
=== ControlStream Resource

==== Introduction

In the CS API Standard, `ControlStream` resources are a special kind of resource that implements the _http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/ActuationCollection[sosa:ActuationCollection]_ concept, with the following restrictions:

- All commands in a `ControlStream` are received by the same `System`.
- All commands in a `ControlStream` share the same controlled properties and the same parameter schema.

This section defines the attributes and associations composing a `ControlStream` resource, but the exact way they are encoded in the payload is defined by each encoding. For encodings defined in this document, please see:

- <<clause-json-controlstream,ControlStream resource as JSON>>

Below is the contextual class diagram of the `ControlStream` resource:

=== ControlStream Canonical URL

The CS API Standard requires that every `ControlStream` resource has a canonical URL.

include::../requirements/controlstream/req_canonical_url.adoc[]



[[clause-controlstream-resources-endpoint]]
=== ControlStream Resources Endpoints

==== Definition

A `DataStream` {resources-endpoint} is an endpoint exposing a set of `ControlStream` resources that can be further filtered using query parameters.

include::../requirements/controlstream/req_resources_endpoint.adoc[]

<<clause-datastream-query-params>> defines additional query parameters applicable to `ControlStream` resources endpoint.

==== Canonical ControlStream Resources Endpoint

The CS API Standard requires that a canonical `ControlStream` resources endpoint, exposing all `ControlStream` resources, be made available by the server.

include::../requirements/controlstream/req_canonical_endpoint.adoc[]

==== Nested ControlStream Resources Endpoints

The set of control streams available on a specific system is available at a nested endpoint under the corresponding `System` resource:

[requirement,model=ogc]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/controlstream/ref-from-system

conditions:: The server implements `http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-connectedsystems-1/1.0/req/system`

part:: The server SHALL implement a {controlstream-resources-endpoint} at path `{api_root}/systems/{sysId}/controlstreams` for each available `System` resource.

part:: The endpoint SHALL only expose the `ControlStream` resources associated to the `System` with ID `sysId`.
====



=== ControlStream Collections

Any number of resources collections containing `ControlStream` resources can be available at a CS API endpoint. `ControlStream` collections are identified with the item type `ControlStream`.

`ControlStream` resources can be grouped into collections according to any arbitrary criteria, as exemplified below:

[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples of ControlStream Collections*

#TODO#
- All data collected by organization X at URL `{api_root}/collections/orgx_datastreams`
- All data collected during a field survey involving multiple sensors at URL `{api_root}/collections/campaignX_datastreams`

_Note that a given control stream can be part of multiple collections at the same time._
====

include::../requirements/controlstream/req_collections.adoc[]



=== CommandStream Schemas

Multiple command formats can be offered for any given control stream. This API provides a way for the server to communicate the schema (_not necessarily a JSON schema_) corresponding to each command format.

Note that a different schema is needed for each individual control stream because the exact content of the command `parameters` property changes according to the properties being controlled.

[[req_controlstream-schemas]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a",options="header"]
|===
^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/controlstream/schema*
^| A | The server SHALL expose the schemas for a given `ControlStream` at URL `{controlStreamResourceUrl}/schema`.
^| B | The server SHALL return a single schema corresponding to the format identified by the mandatory `cmdFormat` query parameter.
|===

.Example
=================
If a control stream reports the following supported command formats:

- `application/json`
- `application/swe+csv`
- `application/swe+binary`

The schema for each of these formats is obtained with the following requests, respectively:

- `\https://{api_root}/controls/{id}/schema?cmdFormat=application/json`
- `\https://{api_root}/controls/{id}/schema?cmdFormat=application/swe%2Bcsv`
- `\https://{api_root}/controls/{id}/schema?cmdFormat=application/swe%2Bbinary`

Note that the media type in the request has to be properly URL encoded.
=================

[NOTE]
The exact content of a schema resource is defined by each encoding. See section <<clause-encoding-json>> for example schemas used for commands encoded using the default JSON format.



=== Command Resources

In the CS API Standard, `Command` resources are a special kind of resource that implements a generalization of the _http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Actuation[sosa:Actuation]_ concept.

In the CS API, `Command` resources are always associated to a `ControlStream` (e.g. a type of http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/ActuationCollection[ActuationCollection]). Some properties of the command (e.g. link to the parent system, controlled properties) can thus be omitted as they are provided at the control stream level.

In addition, the CS API does not restrict `Command` resources to have a single controlled property. It is thus possible to package the desired value of several controlled parameters in a single command, and processing a command can result in actions on several properties at once (e.g. both orientation and FOV of a camera can be modified with a single 'ptz' command).

Below is the contextual class diagram of the `Command` resource:

|====
| *Name*               | *Definition* | *Data Type* | *Usage*
| `issueTime`          | The time the command was received by the system. | DateTime | Required*
| `executionTime`      | The time period during which the command was executed. The time period ends when the effect of the command has modified all controlled properties of the feature of interest. | TimeExtent | Optional
| `sender`             | Identifier of the user or entity who issued the command | String | Optional
| `currentStatus`      | Current status code of the command (see <<command-status-codes>>). | Enum | Required*
| `parameters`         | The value of the command parameters. | Any | Mandatory
|====

(*) These properties are required when a command is reported by the server but not when creating or updating a command. If provided on creation, they should be ignored by the server.

<<clause-command-query-params>> defines additional query parameters applicable to `Command` resources endpoint.

===== Issue Time Filter

===== Execution Time Filter

===== Sender Filter

===== Status Filter

==== Canonical Command Resources Endpoint

The CS API Standard requires that a canonical `Command` resources endpoint, exposing all `Command` resources, be made available by the server.

include::../requirements/command/req_canonical_endpoint.adoc[]

==== Nested Command Resources Endpoint

The set of commands received within a specific control stream is available at a nested endpoint under the corresponding `ControlStream` resource:

[requirement,model=ogc]

identifier:: /req/controlstream/cmd-ref-from-controlstream

part:: The server SHALL implement a <<clause-commands-endpoint,Command resources endpoint>> at path `{api_root}/controlstream/{csId}/commands` for each available `ControlStream` resource.

part:: The endpoint SHALL only expose the `Command` resources that are part of the parent `ControlStream` with ID `csId`.

=== Command Collections

Any number of resources collections containing `Command` resources can be available at a CS API endpoint. `Command` collections are identified with the item type `Command`.

`Command` resources can be grouped into collections according to any arbitrary criteria.

include::../requirements/command/req_collections.adoc[]



=== Command Status Resource

`CommandStatus` resources represent a status report describing the state of a command at a given point in time. Several status reports can be issued for any given command.

When commands are processed synchronously, a single status report is provided. But when commands are processed asynchronously, any number of status reports can be provided by the server. They are used to report early acceptance/rejection of the command, scheduling and execution steps as well as failure and cancellations.

Below is the contextual class diagram of the `CommandStatus` resource:

.Command Status Codes
[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header"]
|====
| *Code*      | *Usage*
| PENDING     | The command is pending, meaning it has been received by the system but no decision to accept or reject it has been made.
| ACCEPTED    | The command was accepted by the receiving system. This usually means that the command has passed the first validation steps, but it can still be rejected or fail later during execution.
| REJECTED    | The command was rejected by the receiving system. It won't be executed at all and the `message` property provides the reason for the rejection. This is a final state. No further status updates will be sent.
| SCHEDULED   | The command was validated and effectively scheduled by the receiving system. When this status code is used, the scheduled execution time must be provided.
| UPDATED     | An update to the command was received and accepted. This code must be used if the system supports task updates.
| CANCELED    | The command was canceled by an authorized user. This code must be used if the system supports user driven task cancellations. The `REJECTED` state should be used instead if the command was canceled by the receiving system. This is a final state. No further status updates will be sent.
| EXECUTING   | The command is currently being executed by the receiving system. The status message can provide more information about the current progress. A system can send several status updates with this code but different time stamps to report progress incrementally. In particular, the progress percentage and the end of the (estimated) execution time period can be refined in each update.
| COMPLETED   | The command has completed after a successful execution. The actual execution time must be provided. This is a final state. No further status updates will be sent.
| FAILED      | The command has failed during execution. The error and/or status message provides the reason for failure. This is a final state. No further status updates will be sent.
|====

==== Associations

A `CommandStatus` resource is also required to include the following associations:

WARNING: Move this to a separate requirements class called "Task Results"

=== Command Result

Certain types of commands lead to the production of data (e.g. tasking a system for data collection, triggering a process such a simulation run, etc.).

Different types of result can be attached to a command status report:

- Reference to one or more datastreams containing the result data, with an optional time range.
- Reference to one or more individual observations containing the result data.
- Reference to a collection of observations containing the result data (how the collection is implementation dependent).
- Inline result data encoded as described by the command stream result schema (can be one or more records)

NOTE: In the case of a command result provided inline, the result data may or may not be also recorded in a datastream.

NOTE: The result attached to a command status report 


.Example
=================
Example use cases are the following:

- A command is used to trigger a new run of a chemical plume dispersion model with certain parameters. The output of the model is a time series of particle locations, where each observation provides the location of all particles for a given time (phenomenonTime). Each processed command leads to the creation of a new datastream that will contain all observations resulting for the model run. 

- A command is used to task a UAV to collect video data while orbiting around a building. The output is a set of may observations (i.e. video frames) that are appended to the existing video datastream of the UAV. When the task is completed, a last status report is provided with the `statusCode=COMPLETED` and a reference to the video datastream with a time range selecting the portion of the video stream that is relevant to the task.

- A command is used to task a UAV to collect an image at a specific location. The output is a single observation that is appended to the existing image datastream of the UAV. When the task is completed, a last status report is provided with the `statusCode=COMPLETED` and a reference to the image observation.

- A command is used to task an earth observation satellite to collect imagery to cover a given geographic area (i.e. coverage request). The output is a set of one or more image observations that are appended to the existing image datastream of the EO sensor. When the task is completed, a last status report is provided with the `statusCode=COMPLETED` and references to all the collected image observations.

- A command is used to query the state of a system. The output of the query is provided in the inline result of the command.

- A command is used to trigger a simple on-demand process that computes temporal averages of parameters in a datastream over a certain time period. The output of the process is provided in the inline result of the command.

=================



=== Command Feasibility

The execution of certain commands is sometimes impossible due to internal or external constraints (e.g. conflict with other scheduled commands, conflict with another user that has exclusive control on the system, etc.).

In order for a client to know if a command/task is feasible, without sending the actual command, feasibility channels are supported by the CS API. In addition to providing a binary (i.e. YES/NO) response to a feasibility request, the CS API provides a mechanism to include detailed feasibility analysis in the response (e.g. provide chances of success, provide task execution details), as well as suggest alternatives if the command is not feasible or has a low chance of success.

A feasibility channel is a regular command stream that is associated to the corresponding command channel. The parameters on the feasibility channel are exactly the same as the ones on the associated command channel, but the response is different. Instead of
