== Requirements Class "Resource Events"
include::../requirements/events/requirements_class_resource_events.adoc[]


=== Overview

Resource events are a mechanism by which a CS API client can be notified of certain resource operations:

- Resource creation (e.g. as initiated by an HTTP POST)
- Resource update (e.g. as initiated by an HTTP PUT or PATCH)
- Resource deletion (e.g. as initiated by an HTTP DELETE)

Listening for resource events can be done on a single resource or a set of resources (i.e. a resources endpoint).
