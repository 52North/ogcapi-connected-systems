== Relationship with other OGC/ISO standards (Informative)

This specification is built upon the following OGC/ISO standards.
The geometry concept is presented first, followed by the feature concept.
Note that a feature is _not_ a geometry, but a feature often contains a geometry as one of its attributes.
However it is legal to build features without geometry attribute, or with more than one geometry attributes.

What makes it different from STA

- Fully based on OGC API and API Features

- Integrated with other OGC APIs via links (Features, MovingFeatures, GeoVolumes, 3D Tiles, Coverages, EDR, STA)

- Resource model based on SensorML and O&M ; SOSA/SSN used for semantic tagging

- Supports more complex observation and task types

- Query model decorrelated from resource encoding

- Able to support multiple formats (not only a single JSON model)
  => intend to bring in protobuf encoding for SWE Common


=== Other OGC APIs

#TODO#

This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other Web APIs with a particular focus on OGC APIs.

- system -> link to STA Thing or STA Sensor/Actuator
- datastream -> link to STA Datastream
- control -> link to STA TaskingCapability
- observation result -> link to a Coverages API (large imagery, data cube)
- domain feature -> link to Features API, GeoVolumes, 3D tiles
- system/process -> link to Processes API
