== Requirements Class "Advanced Filtering"
include::requirements/query/requirements_class_advanced_filtering.adoc[]


=== Overview

This requirements class specifies additional filtering options that may be used to select only a subset of the features in a collection.

All filters defined in this section are implemented using URL query parameters and can be used in addition to the ones defined in {ogcapi-features} and {ogcapi-common-2}.



=== Definitions

==== ID List Schema

The following requirement defines a schema for an "identifier list" that is used by several query parameters.
Identifiers in the list can be either local resource IDs or UIDs (URI).

=== Common Feature Filters

The filtering options defined in this section are common to all feature types defined in this Standard, and may also be used with other feature types that are hosted at the same endpoint.

When this requirements class is implemented, the requirements in this class are applicable to all HTTP GET operations used to retrieve items from any collection offered by the server (i.e. it is not allowed to implement this class only for certain collections).

=== Queries on Derived Properties

not only if URIs are equal but also derived properties 
Example, if querying on Location, anything reported SensorLocation and PlatformLocation should also be selected

This is advanced behavior requiring semantic relationships and is this only a recommandation at this stage.

=> Define property ontology in Part3


=== Combination of Filter Parameters





=== Recursive Search

Recursive search allows discovery of subsystems within complex system hierarchies.
