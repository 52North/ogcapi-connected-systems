== Requirements Class "System Features"

=== Overview
include::../requirements/system/requirements_class_system_features.adoc[]

This requirements class specifies how system descriptions are provided using this API.

The `System` resource implements the _http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/System[System]_ concept defined in the <<SOSA-SSN,SSN Ontology>>. `System` resources are used to expose metadata about several kinds of systems and their components, including sensors, actuators, samplers, processes, platforms, etc.

NOTE: `System` resources describe *system instances* (e.g. a sensor device, a UAV platform) while `Procedure` resources are used to describe *system types* (e.g. a particular model of sensor or vehicle, specified using the manufacturer datasheet). Several `System` instances can implement the same `Procedure` (i.e. be of the same model).

NOTE: `System` resources that are tagged as _http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Platform[sosa:Platform]_ implement both _http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/System[ssn:System]_ and _http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Platform[sosa:Platform]_ concepts.

=== System Resources

==== Introduction

In this API, `System` resources are a special kind of feature resource. This section defines the attributes and associations (links to other resources) that apply to this feature type.

The exact way attributes and associations are encoded in the payload is defined by each encoding. For encodings defined in this Standard, please see:

- <<clause-geojson-system,System resource as GeoJSON>>
- <<clause-sensorml-system,System resource as SensorML>>


==== Attributes

|====
| *Name* | *Definition* | *Data Type* | *Usage*
| `uniqueIdentifier`   | The unique identifier of the system in the form of a URI (preferably a URN). This identifier should be persistent and independent of the actual resource URL. | URI | Required
| `name`               | The human readable name of the system. | String | Required
| `description`        | A human readable description for the system. | String | Optional
| `systemType`         | The type of system (see <<system-types>>). | URI or CURIE | Required
| `assetType`          | The type of asset involved in the system (see <<asset-types>>). | URI or CURIE | Optional
| `validTime`          | The validity period of the system's description. | DateTime | Optional
| `location`           | The current location of the system. | Point | Optional
|====

include::../requirements/system/req_other_attributes.adoc[]

More specific system types are implemented by tagging the resource with a more specific concept URI (see <<system-types>>).

[#system-types,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.System Types
[width="100%",cols="5,10,5,15",options="header"]
|====
| *System Type* | *URI* | *CURIE* | *Usage*
| Sensor      | http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sensor           | sosa:Sensor    | When the system's primary activity is 'sensing' or 'observing'.
| Actuator    | http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Actuator         | sosa:Actuator  | When the system's primary activity is 'actuating'.
| Sampler     | http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sampler          | sosa:Sampler   | When the system's primary activity is 'sampling'.
| Platform    | http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Platform         | sosa:Platform  | When the system's primary activity is 'carrying' other systems.
| System      | http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/System            | ssn:System     | For all other system types.
|====

NOTE: Tagging a `System` resource with a particular type only carries semantic meaning and does not imply any API functionality. In particular, all types of systems can receive commands and generate datastreams.

A `System` resource can also be tagged with an "asset type" attribute used to further qualify the type of assets composing the system.

include::../requirements/system/rec_asset_type.adoc[]

[#asset-types,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Asset Types
[width="100%",cols="5,10,5,15",options="header"]
|====
| *Asset Type* | *URI* | *CURIE* | *Usage*
| Equipment    | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Equipment#     | sml:Equipment | The system is composed of one or more hardware devices or pieces of equipment, that interact directly with the real-world and can be either automated or manually operated (e.g. sensor or actuator device, vehicle, robot, etc.).
| Human        | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Human#         | sml:Human | The system consists of one or more human beings that follow well defined procedures (e.g. conducting polls or surveys, collecting samples, carrying sensors, etc.). 
| Living Thing | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/LivingThing#   | sml:LivingThing | The system consists of one or more animals or other living organisms (most often used with `systemType=Platform` when it carries sensors).
| Simulation   | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Simulation#    | sml:Simulation | The system is a software algorithm that simulates or predict the state of the real-world (e.g. weather forecasts, mathematical models, training simulations, etc.).
| Process      | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Process#       | sml:Process | The system is a process or process chain that transforms data coming from or going to other systems.
| Group        | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Group#         | sml:Group | The system represents a group of similar systems (e.g. sensor network, vehicle fleet, etc.). Such system usually has subsystems that provide detailed information about each member in the group.
| Other        | #http://www.opengis.net/def/x-OGC/TBD/Other#         | sml:Other | Any other type of asset not accounted for in this list. In this case, an application specific property can be used to provide the type.
|====

NOTE: Deployments can be used to document how different types of systems are used together. For instance, a deployment may describe how a "human" (e.g. system of type platform) uses a piece of "equipment" (e.g. system of type sensor) according to a well defined procedure.

==== Location

It is recommended that the `System` resource representation includes the latest known location of the system. If the implementation decides to report the location, it must be done according to the optional `datetime` request parameter.

include::../requirements/system/req_location.adoc[]

include::../requirements/system/req_location_time.adoc[]

==== Associations

A `System` resource is also required to include certain associations with related resources.

include::../requirements/system/req_associations.adoc[]

[#system-assocs,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.System Associations
[width="100%",cols="5,10,10,5",options="header"]
|====
| *Name* | *Definition* | *Target Content* | *Usage*
| `procedure`         | The `Procedure` implemented by the `System`. | A single `Procedure` resource. | Required
| `subsystems`        | The components of the `System`, if any. | A collection of `System` resources (inline or by-reference). | Required
| `samplingFeatures`  | The `Sampling Features` associated to the `System`, if any. | A collection of `SamplingFeature` resources (inline or by-reference). | Required
| `datastreams`       | The `DataStreams` that are generated by the `System`, if any. | A collection of `DataStream` resources (inline or by-reference). | Optional
| `controlstreams`    | The `ControlStreams` that can receive commands for the `System`, if any. | A collection of `ControlStream` resources (inline or by-reference). | Optional
| `deployments`       | The `Deployments` that the `System` is part of, if any. | A collection of `Deployment` resources (inline or by-reference). | Optional
|====

NOTE: The `deployments` association will typically only point to deployments that are known to the server, but there can be other deployments (hosted at other endpoints) that are unknown to the server and also include the selected system.

NOTE: Required associations may be ommitted only if the target resource does not exist or is not available online.

include::../requirements/system/req_assoc_urls.adoc[]


=== System Collections

`System` feature collections are identified with the feature type `system`.

include::../requirements/system/req_collections_type.adoc[]

A default resource collection containing all systems must be available at the API endpoint.

include::../requirements/system/req_collections_catchall.adoc[]

In addition to the default (mandatory) feature collection containing all systems, `System` resources can also be grouped into collections according to any arbitrary criteria. Any number of feature collections containing `System` features can be available at the API endpoint.

include::../requirements/system/req_collections_others.adoc[]


[example%unnumbered]
====
*Examples*

- All unmanned systems at URL `{api_root}/collections/uxs_systems`
- All UAV systems at URL `{api_root}/collections/uav_systems`
- All systems operated by organization X at URL `{api_root}/collections/orgx_systems`
- All currently deployed systems at URL `{api_root}/collections/deployed_systems`

Note that a given system can be part of all 4 collections at the same time.
====


=== Canonical URLs

As shown in the examples above, it is allowed for any given system to be part of several collections at the same time. Thus this standard also requires that a `System` resource has a canonical URL through which it can be retrieved independently of its membership to any collection.

include::../requirements/system/req_canonical_url.adoc[]
