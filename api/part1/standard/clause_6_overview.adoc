== Overview
=== General

OGC Web API Standards enable access to resources using the HTTP protocol and its associated operations (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.). 

This Standard defines resource types that allow the provision of metadata about all kinds of devices, hardware components or processes that can transmit and/or receive data via communication networks (a.k.a. connected systems), including sensors, platforms, robots, human observers, forecast models, computer simulations, etc.

This Standard is an extension of {ogcapi-features} and defines specific feature collections, feature types and filtering mechanisms that are also dependent on building blocks from {ogcapi-common}. Therefore, an implementation of this Standard shall first satisfy the appropriate Requirements Classes from these two Standards. In addition, this Standard has dependencies on some OGC and non-OGC encoding standards. All dependencies are clearly identified in each Requirements Class.


=== Design Considerations

While this is the first version of the OGC API - Connected Systems series, the fine-grained access to sensor related data, including sensor metadata, observations and tasking over the Web has been supported by the <<OGC-SOS,OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS)>>, <<OGC-SPS,OGC Sensor Planning Service (SPS)>> and <<OGC-STA-1,SensorThings API>> Standards and their various implementations for many years.

SOS and SPS were designed in the early 2000s and use a Remote-Procedure-Call-over-HTTP architectural style and XML for any payloads, while SensorThings is a newer OGC Standard that was the first to adopt the REST architecture style with JSON payloads.

OGC API - Connected Systems supports all capabilities from these previous Standards, but using a modernized approach that follows the current Web architecture and in particular the W3C/OGC best practices for sharing Spatial Data on the Web as well as the latest OGC API guidelines.

The API is designed as an extension of {ogcapi-features} which makes it entirely compatible with Features API clients, while still allowing more advanced functionality to access dynamic data associated to features. A clear goal of this approach is to better integrate the GIS and sensor/IoT communities. 

Another key design decision was also to allow linking to other OGC APIs whenever possible, thus allowing a much better integration with the rest of the OGC API ecosystems.

Models from the {ogc-w3c-ssn} are the basis for the API design, with the help of more concrete models like O&M and SensorML.


=== Feature Types

All resources defined in Part 1 of this Standard are features and are grouped into feature collections. <<api-class-diagram>> shows a UML class diagram of the Connected Systems API resources (Part 2 resources are shown with a dashed outline).

All resources defined in part 1 of this Standard are feature types, each of which is defined in its own requirements class. The table below provides an overview of these feature types:

[#feature-types,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Overview of feature types defined by this Standard
[width="90%",cols="2,6,4,2"]
|====
| *Feature Type*      | *Description* | *Requirements Class*          | *Possible Encodings*
| System              | <<clause-system-features>> | Description of system instances such as sensors, platforms, human observers, etc.  | GeoJSON, JSON-FG, SML-JSON
| Procedure           | <<clause-procedure-features>> | Description of procedures implemented by systems such as datasheets or methods (e.g. system types). | GeoJSON, JSON-FG, SML-JSON
| Deployment          | <<clause-deployment-features>> | Description of deployments involving one or more systems for a particular purpose. | GeoJSON, JSON-FG, SML-JSON
| Sampling Feature    | <<clause-sampling-features>> | Description of sampling strategies associated to particular systems (e.g. sampling geometry or method). | GeoJSON, JSON-FG
|====

NOTE: The listed encodings are the ones defined in this Standard but extensions can define additional encodings.


=== Collections

<<OGC-API-Features,OGC API - Features>> mandates that its resources be organized into Feature Collections. In addition to the feature types themselves, this Standards specifies how to identify collections that contain a given feature type.

This is done using an additional property on the Collection resource called `featureType`. Each requirements class defining a new feature type also defines the value to use for this property when creating a collection of this feature type.


=== Requirements Classes

Most requirements classes of this Standard can be implemented independently. For example, a given implementation can choose to implement only `System` and `Deployment` features and rely on other servers to host complementary data such as `Procedures`, Domain Features, or Dynamic Data (see part 2 of this Standard).

This is made possible thanks to the use of hyperlinks that don't require that all resources be hosted at the same endpoint.


=== Paged Responses

All collections support paging via the `limit` query parameter and the `next` link, as specified by https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html#_parameter_limit[OGC API - Features] and {ogcapi-common-2}.


=== Search & Filtering

The core search capability is based on https://ogcapi.ogc.org/common/[OGC API-Common] and thus supports:

* Bounding box searches using the `bbox` parameter,
* Time instant or time period searches using the `datetime` parameter,
* Equality predicates on feature properties (i.e. _property_=_value_).

This API extends these core search capabilities to include:

* Geospatial searches using the `geom` parameter that takes a WKT geometry,
* Full-text searches using the `q` parameter (prefix search only).
* Search by feature UID using the `uid` parameter.

Additional filters are defined on a per feature type basis, as shown in the following table:

[#query-params,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Query Parameters
[width="90%",cols="2,4"]
|====
| *Requirements Class*       | *Query Parameters*
| System Features            | `procedure`, `deployment`
| Procedure Features         | -
| Deployment Features        | `system`
| Sampling Features          | `sampledFeature`
|====

See <<clause-advanced-filtering>> for more details.
