# Connected Systems Standards Working Group

## Overview

The Connected Systems SWG is focused on modernization of the SensorML and related Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) Standards as an extension of the OGC API - Features Standard, with an inclusive eye toward all manner of connected systems. This work includes the maintenance and update of SensorML, including development of additional encodings (e.g., JSON), adapting modern, RESTful approaches to SWE Standards (for discovery, tasking, observation access, processing, and portrayal), and integration of these updated Standards with OGC APIs.

## Communication

Most all work on the specification takes place in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/connected_systems/issues), so browse there to get a good idea of what is happening, as well as past decisions.

## Contributing
